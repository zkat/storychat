* Economy
  The economy in this game is based on tokens. These tokens are acquired through
  trade, and through playing scenes. Tokens can then be used for various
  entity-related actions such as purchasing new ones and customizing them
** Tokens
   Every player starts off with 10 tokens. Tokens can be spent on buying
   characters, adding details to characters, purchasing outfits and props, and
   adding details to sets.

   They can also be used (through auction) to buy the privilege to frame the next
   scene.

   See individual game mechanic documents for specific uses for tokens and
   costs.
