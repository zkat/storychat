* Getting started
  Gather 'round on your favorite modern device and visit
  http://storychat.herokuapp.com/play
  
  Everyone should set their name (on the bottom right) to something that
  identifies them, so we can keep track of who's around. If you want to chat,
  switch your input type to "ooc" and type away.
* Choosing characters
  Players should visit http://storychat.herokuapp.com/characters and read
  through the various descriptions. There should be enough characters/roles for
  everyone to get started. Have them pick which ones they want.
* Situation
  Players should be provided with a situation to resolve, and then just let
  them figure out wtf to do.
